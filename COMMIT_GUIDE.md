# ✨ Vibe Commit Style Guide

Use commits that reflect both logic and creativity.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| `feat(vibe)` | New creative feature | `feat(vibe): add animated section transitions 🌙` |
| `refactor(docs)` | Documentation or structure update | `refactor(docs): unify all markdowns into README.md` |
| `style(ui)` | Visual or layout tweaks | `style(ui): enhance card shadows and glow` |
| `chore(sync)` | Maintenance / cleanup | `chore(sync): update dependencies and meta` |

> “Each commit should hum its own rhythm — one flow, one vibe.”
