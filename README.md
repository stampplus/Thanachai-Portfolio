# 🌙 Thanachai Portfolio — Where Code Meets Vibe

> “Between logic and light — code becomes creativity.”

## 🧠 About

Welcome to **Thanachai (Stamp)’s Portfolio**, a space where **AI creativity** and **code aesthetics** coexist.  
This website is not just a showcase — it’s a living canvas that reflects emotion, structure, and flow through digital design.  

Built with **pure HTML**, **TailwindCSS**, and **hand-crafted animations**,  
this project blends minimalism and artistry into an experience that feels both technical and soulful.  

> “Every line of code is a brushstroke on a digital canvas.”

## 🪶 Inspiration & Concept

This portfolio was born from a simple question —  
> “What if design could *feel* alive?”  

The goal was not only to show projects,  
but to **create an experience that feels like music and motion combined.**  
Every gradient, transition, and animation rhythm follows a **human emotion** — calm, focused, introspective.

Thanachai (Stamp) calls this concept **“Vibe Code”** —  
where design is emotion, and code is its heartbeat.  

> 🜂 *Art doesn’t have to speak. It just has to move you.*
